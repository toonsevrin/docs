# Value
One of the challanges that circles faces is to make the currency valuable. Ultimately we want the basic incomes to be worth something. Here we collect different approaches to bootstrap and maintain this value.

## Partial payments
Suppliers can decide to allow a part of the price of a good/service to be paid in circles. This can be mutually beneficial:
* Suppliers target a consumer group that would otherwise not have bought with them (without lowering the price for other customers)
* Consumers receive a discount on their purchases

And ultimately, as a part of the price is now substituted by circles. Circles necessarily become valuable.

## Subsidies / Donations
Another way to increase the value of circles would be by subsidizing this value. These subsidies could come from individuals, firms or even governments.

Bringing value in is actually not as trivial as it may seem. One way to do it could be to buy circles of the market and burn/redistribute them.

Subsidies may become a necessity if the aim is to provide an income sufficient to cover the minimum costs of life.
