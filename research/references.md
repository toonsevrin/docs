## Complementary currencies

### Is our Monetary Structure a Systematic Cause for Financial Instability? - Bernard Lietaer
Lietaer et al. explain how the monoculture of national currencies, justified on the basis of market efficiency, generates structural instability in our global financial system. They then suggest complementary currencies as a necessary diversification. Though complementary currencies decrease efficiency, they increase resilience and thus the overal sustainability of the financial system (up to some point). This is all explained through an analogy with ecosystems.

 >  _Complementary currencies facilitate transactions that otherwise wouldn’t occur, linking
otherwise unused resources to unmet needs, and encouraging diversity and
interconnections that otherwise wouldn’t exist._

People Powered Money is an eBook that offers both decision-makers and practisioners information and advice for implementing a succesful community currency. The book draws on the results of a variety of pilot projects like the WIR and LETS.

### Alternatives to the global financial sector: Local Complementary currencies, LETS and Time backed currencies

This article explores complementary currencies and exchange systems and how they can provide some stability and competition to the vulnerability of the financial markets. The article examines timebank systems, a particular type of complementary currencies and exchange system, and provides guidance on issues to consider in develop them.  One of the finding from the evaluation is that as the number of people in the timebank system increases then more formality is needed to moderate the system and reduce potential for misuse.
