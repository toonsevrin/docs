# Circles: Research Documentation

Research on circles used to be scattered all over the place: The chatroom, private messages, Google Drive... Getting a grasp over the current state of research was thus extremely difficult for newcomers.

Unifying this information is therefor the main goal of this repo, making it the primary location for any circles related research.

## Categories
The research on circles has been divided in the following categories \[these categories are not final and will be discussed\]:
* __Value:__ Bootstrapping the value of the currency and maintaining this value
* __Governance:__ Governance protocols for the updating of the smart contract
* __Stability:__ The network should be resilient/stable, even in the face of shocks
  * __Inflation:__ Hyperinflation should be prevented
  * __Sybil attacks:__ These should not be possible at a large scale
* __Usability:__ The system should be easy to use

## Bookmarks
Interesting articles and our summaries/opinions of them are available in the references.md in each directory.
