# Governance
Rules and ideas for the decision-making protocols within circles.

## Governance protocol
The governance protocol will be specified in the Governance Manifesto. This document will be published once it is finalised. In will lay at the foundation for decentralised, transparent and inclusive decision-making.

## Implementation
The Governance Manifesto does not specify how it should be implemented. Ideally the whole protocol should function without a decentralised party. There are a couple of ways to do this.

### New members
How should new members be introduced as voters?

#### Voted in
New members could be voted in by existing members. Without optimization, this does not scale well. This could be made more scalable if members automatically accept members from validators they trust.
